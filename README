To compile you'll need:
1) the auto-pipe/X-language compiler and glib > 2.0 
2) compile the quickparselib first with appropriate options
3) define a mapping and algorithm in the x language with appropriate 
   dataflow edges.
4) compile with ap build system.


NOTE:  If using OS X, core affinity doesn't work.
